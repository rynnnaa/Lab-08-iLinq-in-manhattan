## Summary
Read in a JSON file that contains a data set of location information for properties in Manhattan. Use LINQ queries and Lambda statements to output the following in the console: all of the neighborhoods in this data list, filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names, remove the Duplicates, then consolodate all into a single query.

## Step By Step Directions ("Happy Path")

* User must create a new project in Visual Studio. 
* User must push project to Github.
* User must create a README.md (after pushing project to Github.
* User must utilize a JSON that contains a data set of location information.
* User must use queries to get location information.
* User must Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list
* User must Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
* User must Remove the Duplicates
* User must Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.
* User must Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ instead of a Lambda and vice versa.)
* No testing is required
